This is a simple editor for metatiles, metametatiles, and rooms for homebrew NES games. This was written to adapt to my workflow. It is originally intended to be incorporated in games written in C (using libraries like https://github.com/nesdoug), but the output can be probably be adapted to be used with assembly as well.
